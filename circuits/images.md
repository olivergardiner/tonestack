# Image processing workflow

The images for tonestack are created in Visio and are all in the circuits.vsdx file and then they are exported to svg files. Visio will allow you to export a PNG file directly, in which case, the height of the resulting image should be set to 400px. NB: QT will scale the image so it's not critical but this gives sensible results in terms of resolution.

As an alternative to creating the PNG files directly in Visio, they can be exported to SVG and then processed in (e.g.) Inkscape where the export options are a little bit more straightforward.

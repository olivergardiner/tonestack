<h1>The Secret Freq filter section</h1>

<p>The Fulltone Secret Freq is an interesting pedal because a) it offers a genuinely different way of shaping  a distortion effect, and b) considerable effort has been put into keeping the circuit secret by covering key parts in black epoxy. In essence, the Secret Freq is a soft clipping distortion stage (with asymmetric clipping for more 2nd harmonics), followed by a swept band boost filter. It is this latter part of the circuit that has been the subject of much speculation on various forums and the significant part of this filter is a "gyrator" circuit which creates a variable impedance to ground in the feedback loop of an op amp. The gyrator operates in conjunction with some low pass pre-filtering. As a consequence, the overall frequency response is not that of a "classic" band pass filter, which perhaps explains the specific appeal of this pedal.</p>

<p>Note that the Freqency pot is generally assumed to have a linear taper - you may wish to experiement with a reverse log ("C") taper as this makes the lower end of the pot range more useful.</p>

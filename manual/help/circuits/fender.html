<h1>The Fender Tonestack</h1>

<p>The classic Fender tone stack is one of the big three FMV stacks and is very similar in layout to the Marshall tone stack, the main difference being the connection of the "mid" control which is wired as a variable resistor. This tone stack is integral to the Fender sound but has (at least) one quirk in that, unlike the Marshall topology, setting all controls to minimum shorts the filter output to ground and the amp is silent.</p>

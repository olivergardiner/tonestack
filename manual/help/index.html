<h1>Tonestack</h1>

<p>Welcome to Tonestack - an update of Duncan's Tonestack Calculator. Tonestack is essentially a circuit simulator for a library of tone stacks commonly found in a range of guitar amplifiers (often valve amplifiers). However, while it is useful to understand the response of tone controls when designing amplifiers, it is can also be useful to simulate frequency responses in a wide range of other audio design contexts (e.g. designing guitar pedals).</p>

<p>The original Tonestack Calculator uses linear algebra to solve the equations need for passive tone controls whereas Tonestack uses the NG Spice circuit simulation library - this makes it very easy to manage new circuits, including active circuits.</p>
